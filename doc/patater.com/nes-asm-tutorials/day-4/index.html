<h2>WHAT!?!</h2>

<p>That's right, today we create and load a palette. To create the palette,
we'll use the program PAL.exe which I gave you in that zip file in Day 1. Run
it, you will see a window with 32 gray boxes which you can fill in by drawing
colors from the colored boxes on the bottom. Make sure when you make your
palette that you make the first color on each row black or you'll get some
funky results when we make backgrounds and sprites.</p>

<p>Save the palette as our.pal, to save click the only menu and click the
option with the word save in it. Good. If you didn't do all that and got pissed
that I made you run a program that wasn't the assembler itself, click <a href="../../gbaguy/our.pal">here</a> to download my palette that I made for you. :)</p>

<div class="note">
<h4>What a palette is, plain and simple</h4>
<em>If I say something contradictory to this paragraph later in this
file, ignore it.</em>
<p>
A palette is basically a bunch of colors to pick from. Our palette is 32 colors
/bytes (1 color = 1 byte) long. 16 colors for the sprite palette, 16 colors for
the BG palette. Even though you can pick from 16 you can only use 4 per sprite
or 4 per 16x16 piece of BG. Doing this is a little more complicated that what
we've done so far, so I won't cover it yet. OK, actually I just haven't done it
yet, so how am I supposed to teach you how to do it?</p>
</div>

<h3>How We Load The Pallete?</h3>

<p>To load the palette, we write to 2 memory registers, $2006 twice to give it
the full address ($3F00) that we are going to load the palette to. And then we
just keep giving $2007 byte after byte of our palette until we've given it all
of the palette.</p>

<p>However, before we load the palette, we need to learn a few other things.</p>

<h3>Indexed Addressing</h3>

<p>Maybe you remember in Day 1 or 2, when I said that X and Y registers can be
involved in Indexed Addressing. So this is how it works, k? :</p>
<p><code class="block">
    ;Assume X is 6.</code></p>

<pre><code>lda $2002, x    ; loads A with value at memory location ($2002+6) so
; memory location read is $2008.

;Assume Y is 9;

lda $2000, y    ; loads A with value at memory location ($2000+9) so
; memory location read is $2009. &lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that you can load any register and use indexed addressing, not just A.
</p>

<h3>The Other Thing.</h3>

<p>The other thing you need to know (and should have figured out already) is that
load (and maybe store) instructions can take a label as the base address.
here's some code to illustrate:</p>
<p><code class="block">
    somelabel: .incbin "our.pal"  ; include a pal file and label it's location.</code></p>

<pre><code>lda somelabel, x  ; load A with value from location (somelabel's address+X register's
                  ; value). &lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Please remember that unless I say otherwise, examples that just load A with
something are just as applicable to loading X or Y. You should already know how
label's work, if you don't you shouldn't be reading this. Go read my <a href="../../gbaguy/x86asm.htm">Intel ASM Tutor</a> or other
basic assembly book/article. Like I said before, you should already know some
kind of assembly language and label's are basic to ALL of them. So there.</p>

<h3>Loading The Pallete</h3>

<p>Instead of me blabing my keyboard off, how 'bout we let the code
explain it? :</p>
<p><code class="block">
    lda #$3F   ; these 4 lines tell $2006 that we
    sta $2006  ; want the stuff we load $2007 with
    lda #$00   ; to start at memory location $3F00
    sta $2006  ; . Note that since we can only store a byte at a time we store twice
    ; to get the whole address in there.</code></p>

<pre><code>ldx #$00   ; load X with 0. loadpal:   ; note that labels are followed by a ':' and aren't tabbed in.
lda ourpal, x   ; load A with palette value at location ourpal + x.

sta $2007       ; store the next palette value into $2007 which will put it in
; the right place for us.

inx    ; you've never seen this instruction before but it stands for INcrement X.
; it adds 1 to X.

cpx #32   ; ComPare X with 32 which is how many palette values we need to load.

bne loadpal  ; bne stands for Branch on Not Equal, so this will branch to loadpal
; if X wasn't equal to 32. If X is 32, then the loop will stop and were done
; loading the palette. &lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
Assume ourpal is a label that is defined later in the source file that looks something
like this:</p>
<p><code class="block">
ourpal: .incbin "our.pal"   ; label our palette for use in the loading code.
</code></p>

<p>We will put together a complete code file when we get a sprite displayed tomorrow.</p>

<p>Here's that again without the comments:</p>
<p><code class="block">
    lda #$3F
    sta $2006
    lda #$00
    sta $2006</code></p>

<pre><code>ldx #$00 loadpal:
lda ourpal, x
sta $2007
inx
cpx #32
bne loadpal &lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>The New Instructions</h3>

<p>You may have noticed the 3 new instructions in the loading code. They are</p>
<dl>
    <dt>INX</dt><dd> - Adds 1 to X. There is also INY which adds 1 to Y. There
    is NO INA I heard that the designers of the 6502 just forgot it. There is a
    INA on the next version of the 6502 (the 65c02) that is used on the
    SNES.</dd>

    <dt>CPX</dt><dd> - Compares a value with X. There is also CPY and CPA which
    compare things with Y and A respectively. You can only use immediate values
    here.  NO MEMORY ADDRESSES ALLOWED.</dd>

    <dt>BNE</dt><dd> - Jumps to a label if the result of the last CPk (k is A
    or X or Y) instruction was Not Equal. There is also BEQ which jumps if the
    result was EQual. There are a few more that I'll explain when they come
    up.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>This Day In Review</h3>

<p>Loading the palette is EXTREMELY important as a background or a sprite is
NOTHING without it's palette. Loading a palette is basically all you need to do
to it as once it's there, it does it's job without any help from you. Tomorrow
a sprite.</p>

    All hail the NES! Good-night,<br />
