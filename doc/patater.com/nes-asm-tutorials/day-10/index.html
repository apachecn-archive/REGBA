<h2>Sprite DMA?</h2>
<p>Yep, Sprite DMA. You remember how we wrote to SPR-RAM (OAM) with $2003
and $2004? Well, this is actually unrealiable on the real system (or so I've heard).
What we actually need to do is utalize (utallise?) memory as OAM, and then put a
number into a register and everything is copied for us automatically into the actual
OAM. If you didn't get that it'll (hopefully) become clearer as we do it.</p>

<h3>What Memory?</h3>

<p>As I said above, we need to use our "variable" memory to make a sort of
duplicate of OAM. In this tutorial we will use $0300 for our OAM Copy if you will,
and you will, 'cause I will/am... nevermind. ok... Note that there are only something
like 64 sprites on the NES so this only really takes (64*4(4bytes for each entry)=256
bytes aways from what we can use. So basically, leave all your "variables" at $0000-$0200
and only go over $0500 with your "variables" if you have to.</p>

<p>Now when I say that we'll be using $0300 for an OAM Copy, I mean that it will
(actually HAS to) be the same layout as the regular OAM. Also, try to remember that
$0300 is a memory <em>address</em>, which is somewhat different from a memory <em>register</em>
as in we have to increment the address every write/store ourselfs rather than just keep giving
values to a (memory) register.</p>

<p>Also (alot of alsos, I know... I just want to make this as clear as possible),
there is a reason we use an even number in the hundreds for our OAM Copy. I'll tell
you in the next section.</p>

<p>Alright, hopefully you get the theory. Now let's see some assembler!
Here goes:</p>
<p><code class="block">
;;--- START OF CODE ---;;
    .inesmap 0  ;
    .inesprg 1  ; I do these in different orders sometimes, it doesn't matter
    .ineschr 1  ; as long as you keep the 1s with the right ones. I hope that
    .inesmir 1  ; didn't confuse you as much as I just confused myself. ;)</code></p>

<pre><code>.bank 1
.org $FFFA
.dw 0
.dw Start
.dw 0

.bank 0  ; code bank
.org $0000 ; variable ORG location $0000

; normally variables defined here

.org $0300 ; OAM Copy location $0300
</code></pre>

<p>Sprite1_Y:     .db  0   ; sprite #1’s Y value
Sprite1_T:     .db  0   ; sprite #1’s Tile Number
Sprite1_S:     .db  0   ; sprite #1’s special byte
Sprite1_X:     .db  0   ; sprite #1’s X value
Sprite2_Y:     .db  0   ; same thing, same order for sprite #2
Sprite2_T:     .db  0   ; note that I numbered 1 2 …
Sprite2_S:     .db  0   ; some people may actually prefer starting
Sprite2_X:     .db  0   ; the count at 0, but it doesn’t really matter.
; this would just go on and on for however many sprites you have</p>

<pre><code>.org $8000 ; code ORG location $8000
</code></pre>

<p>Start:
    ; code goes here, the code that goes here or atleast the code to get the
    ; above sprite definitions into the actual OAM, will be given in the next
    ; section.</p>

<p>infin:
    jmp infin  ; infinite loop
;;— END OF CODE FILE —;;
&lt;/code&gt;</p>

<p>If you don't get it, email me telling exactly what you don't get.</p>

<h3>The DMA Register</h3>

<p>The DMA Register is $4014. We want to write a 3 to it. Why 3? Because
our OAM Copy is at $0<u>3</u>00. Writing to the register causes the stuff at
$0n00 (where 'n' is the number we wrote) to be copied into the actual OAM.
So if we had our stuff at $0400 we would write a 4, if it was at $0500 then
write a 5. Get it? I sure hope so. If not tell me please, I will not hesitate
to help you.</p>

<p>So, now to get our values in the actual OAM assuming we put the sprite's info
in the Sprite#-whatever "variables", we just go like this:</p>
<p><code class="block">
    lda #$3  ; could be #3, 3 is the same hex and decimal (obviously).
    sta $4014 ; when we write to it, the copy from $0300+ to actual OAM, is carried out.
</code></p>

<p>That's it! It's not only more reliable than our old method, it's easier!</p>

<h3>How to modify Day 9's code to use this method.</h3>

<p>Well, we need to do several things. First, copy the .org $0300 and stuff
over our old variables section. We don't need the variables any more (for
sprite info that is) because we're using the OAM Copy itself for the sprite's X
and Y.</p>

<p>Second, use a find and replace function to replace all the 'X_Pos' and
'Y_Pos' with 'Sprite1_X' and 'Sprite1_Y' respectively.</p>

<p>Third find the block of code that loads $2003 with a value and then proceeds to
write to $2004 several times. Find that block of code and replace it with:</p>
<p><code class="block">
    lda #3
    sta $4014
</code></p>

<p>That should be it! We also save several bytes of code with this method.</p>

<h3>This Day In Review</h3>

<p>Hope you enjoy Sprite DMA, I tried to make it as painless as possible.  Now
that we have a better way to put data in OAM, we can look at a better way to
capture VBlank tomorrow. On to interrupts...</p>
