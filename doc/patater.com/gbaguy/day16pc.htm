<h2 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>Mischief #1</b></h2>
<p style="color: green;"><pre><b>
	Today, we will be mischievious! This following program will crash any DOS/Win9x computer so
bad you'll need a reboot and ctrl+alt+del isn't going to help.

<h2 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>The Program</b></h2>
	This program won't harm anything, but don't take my word on that. I take no responsibility for
this program. Code:

	;;---CODE START---;;
		mov ah,0
		mov al,13h
		int 10h
label:
		cli    ; disable interrupts from happening
		jmp label
	;;---CODE END---;;

The CLI instruction CLears Interrupts from happening, including the internal keyboard interrupts that
happen every time a key is pressed.

You don't use CLI too often, but it's good to know about.

<h2 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>This Day In Review</b></h2>

	I just had to tell about this!

	Have fun!,
		-Mike
