<h2>What?</h2>
<p>Today, we will use a new loading loop that utilizes <em>indirect addressing</em>
to load a lot of data at a time. The data we will load will be the Zelda title
screen, and yes, today will include all of the code. I've included the 3 necessary
data files in <a href="../../gbaguy/nesasm.zip">nesasm.zip</a>. Please redownload it, I could
have sworn that I already had them in there... sorry for any inconveniece.</p>

<h2>Indirect Addressing?</h2>
<p>Yep, indirect addressing (which is hard for me to type for some reason...)
is simply getting an address from the contents of another address, so say we
wanted to get a value from an address contained at $0010-$0011 (16-bit address,
remember that).</p>

<p>But first a little review (I hope), vocab lesson #whatever: Take the address
$8000, $00 is the high byte and $80 is the low byte, got it?  (I might have
that backwards, I have bronchitis at the moment...)</p>

<p>The low byte would be in $10 and the high byte in $11 (note that I use two
digits only, because the first 2 in the address are zero). So assuming the address
that we really want to load from is $82C5 which is at $10-$11, to load the byte
at $82C5 into the A register, we would do:</p>
<p><code class="block">
    lda [$10]
</code></p>

<p>this can also be indexed, like so:</p>
<p><code class="block">
    lda [$10], y
</code></p>

<p>What this would do is take the address $82C5, add the contents of Y to that
address (the <em>address</em> not the contents), and get byte at the resulting
address.</p>

<p>I hope you understood all that, because it's just going to get more confusing.
And just a short joke before we continue:</p>

<h3>The Loop</h3>
<p>I think, therefore I am? no. I think therefore I'll give the complete
loop and explain it in pieces. Assume backg is the label of where a bunch of
name table data is included, also assume $2006 is pointing to $2000:</p>
<p><code class="block">
    lda #low(backg)
    sta $10
    lda #high(backg)
    sta $11</code></p>

<pre><code>ldx #4
ldy #0 loop:
lda [$10],y
sta $2007
iny
bne loop
inc $11
dex
bne loop &lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The first piece:</p>
<p><code class="block">
    lda #low(backg)
    sta $10
    lda #high(backg)
    sta $11
</code></p>

<p><code>low()</code> and <code>high()</code> are builtin instructions for
NESASM.exe that take the high and low bytes of an address, in this case,
backg.</p>

<p>Note that $10 and $11 memory addresses are consecutive, it has to be that
way, but they could be any consecutive addresses.</p>

<p>The second:</p>
<p><code class="block">
    ldx #4
    ldy #0
loop:
</code></p>

<p>X controls how many chunks of 256 bytes to load in this case, 4. Y must be 0 (zero).</p>

<p>The third:</p>
<p><code class="block">
    lda [$10],y
    sta $2007
    iny
    bne loop
</code></p>

<p>This part loads 256 bytes to $2007 using indirect addressing indexed by Y.
Note that the registers (A,X,Y) wrap around so adding 1 to #$FF will make the
register contain #$00. And that's how this works, because when Y is incremented
to #$00, the loop will be done loading the 256 byte chunk.</p>

<p>The last:</p>
<p><code class="block">
    inc $11
    dex
    bne loop
</code></p>

<p>This part increments the high byte of the address of the data to the next
256 byte chunk. It also counts down 1 in the X register which contains the
amount of chunks left, if X is zero, it won't loop and we're done loading
everything.</p>

<p>That went better than I expected...</p>

<h3>The Full Code File</h3>
<p>Before I give you the full code file (fully commented, of course), make sure
you have those 3 files in your code folder.</p>
<p><code class="block">
;--- CODE START ---;
    .inesmir 1
    .inesmap 0      ; INES header $H!7.
    .ineschr 1
    .inesprg 1</code></p>

<pre><code>.bank 1
.org $FFFA  ; vector table
.dw 0
.dw Start
.dw 0

.bank 0
.org $0010 addrLO: .db 0  ; make "variable"s for our indirect addressing addrHI: .db 0

.org $8000 Start:

ldx #0
lda #$20  ; set the destination address in PPU memory
sta $2006  ; should be $2000
stx $2006
lda #low(backg)   ; put the high and low bytes of the address "backg"
sta addrLO        ; into the variables so we can use indirect addressing.
lda #high(backg)
sta addrHI

ldx #4  ; number of 256-byte chunks to load
ldy #0 loop:
lda [addrLO],y
sta $2007     ; load 256 bytes
iny
bne loop ;--------------------
inc addrHI  ; increment high byte of address backg to next 256 byte chunk
dex        ; one chunk done so X = X - 1.
bne loop   ; if X isn't zero, do again



lda #$3F
sta $2006
lda #$00    ; point $2006 to the palette
sta $2006
ldx #$00 palload:
lda tilepal, X     ; use a simple load of 32 bytes.
inx
sta $2007
cpx #32
bne palload

jsr turn_screen_on  ; call subroutine to turn on / setup the PPU.
</code></pre>

<p>infin:              ; our infinite loop
    jmp infin</p>

<p>turn_screen_on:
    ; Setup the PPU
    lda #%00001000
    sta $2000
    lda #%00011110
    sta $2001
    rts</p>

<p>tilepal: .incbin “zelda.pal” ; include the palette
backg: .incbin “zelda.nam” ; include the name table data</p>

<pre><code>.bank 2
.org $0000
.incbin "zelda.chr"  ; include the picture data in the background part
;of the CHR-BANK (#2) ;;--- CODE END/ END OF FILE ---;; &lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I hope you got all that and that it works (I did some modifications from my
testing file).</p>

<h3>This Day In Review</h3>

<p>I thought that was fun. Day 20 could be anything, maybe Attributes, maybe a
lesson on the conditional branches.</p>

<p>
    Have fun!,<br />
