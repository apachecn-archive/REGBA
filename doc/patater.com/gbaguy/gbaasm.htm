<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<p>In August of 2004 (which it is at time of writting), I finally got around to start
rewritting the GBA ASM Tutorials. These probably won't be as friendly to the total
stranger to ASM, but they'll (hopefully) be alot better at showing how to use ASM effectively.
These will also move slower. Sprites was Day 5 before, this time, in <i>Chapter</i> 5 we've only got
to overviewing the gfx modes. This time around it is required that you know C or C++ and have been programming
the GBA for a while. If you still want to read the old version, go <a href="http://k2pts.home.comcast.net/gbaguy/oldgba/gbaasm.htm">here</a>.

<p>These are a work in progress, any of these are subject to change.</p>
