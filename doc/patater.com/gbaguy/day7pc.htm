<h2 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>Compare and Jump</b></h2>
<p style="color: green;"><pre><b>
	Using the CMP (compare) instruction along with the conditional jump instructions,
we get the if construct of high level languages.

<h2 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>The CMP Instruction</b></h2>
	The CMP Instruction is used to compare two things. It is used such as

		cmp ax,6  ; will compare AX and 6
		cmp ah,bl  ; will compare AH and BL
		var1 dw 0
		cmp ax,var1  ; will compare AX and the value in var1

	Note that CMP doesn't modify any registers or memory.

<h2 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>The Conditional Jumps</b></h2>
	Conditional jumps jump to a label if the current condition (set by CMP) is
true. The conditional jumps include:

	JMP - Will jump no matter what, doesn't check conditions.
	JE  - Will jump if compared things are equal.
	JNE - Will jump if comparison is not equal.
	JA  - Will jump if the first thing is greater.
	JB  - Will jump if the first thing is less.

Here's some sample code:

	mov ax,6
	cmp ax,bx  ; compare AX with BX
	ja Above  ; jump to label Above if AX > BX
	je Equal  ; jump to label Equal if AX == BX
	jb Below  ; jump to label Below if AX < BX

Note that you can't use RET with a jump and there are no conditional CALLs, you have to
jump to somewhere that'll do the call and then jump back or something like that.

<h2 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>Some Code</b></h2>
	This will output the numbers from 9 to 0:

;;---CODE START---;;
	mov ah,10
again:
	sub ah,1
	cmp ah,0  ; check if AH is 0
	je endofit   ; if AH is 0 goto endofit
	push ax
	add ah,30h ; turn a digit into it's ASCII by adding 30h
	mov dl,ah
	mov ah,2
	int 21h  ; output the digit
	pop ax  ; get the number back
	jmp again ; do it again
endofit:
	mov ah,4ch
	int 21h
;;---CODE END---;;

There's a better way to do that, if you find it, you don't get
hit with an imaginary trout.

Hope you enjoyed that! :)

	Hope you're having fun, I know I am!

	Happy coding!,
